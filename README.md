## About
Hero-Wars merges the first-person shooting from Counter-Strike with the role-playing from games like World of Warcraft.
Each player has a set of heroes, from which he can choose one to play with.
Killing enemies or completing basic CS:GO objectives (plant/defuse bomb, rescue hostage) grants experience points for the hero, which will eventually allow him to level up (after reaching the required experience points). Each level grants the hero a skill point, which can then be spent to level up that hero's skills, thus making the hero stronger.
You will also gain gold from kills and objectives, which can be used to unlock new heroes.

## Installation
#### Step 1
To install Hero-Wars onto your CS:Source or CS:GO server, you will need to download [Source.Python](http://forums.sourcepython.com/) addon for your game. You can read more about Source.Python from their website, but basically it allows us to use Python 3 programming language to interact with the Source game engine.
Hero-Wars is written in Python 3, so that's why you need to install Source.Python first.
#### Step 2
Simply download Hero-Wars from this github repository (https://github.com/Hero-Wars-Dev-Team/Hero-Wars) and install it onto your server by extracting the **addons** and **resources** folders into your game's local directory (called **csgo** or **cstrike**, depending on your game).
#### Step 3
Hero-Wars is now installed, and you only need to load it onto your server. This can be done through the console by entering the command `sp load hw`, which can also be included in your **autoexec.cfg** so you don't have to always write it.
